Nursery</h2>
<article class="container2">
<section class="column1">
	<h3>Facilities</h3>
	<p style="text-align:left;"> 
	This room caters for a maximum of 12 children aged from 6 weeks to 2 years.
	With a ratio of one staff member to four children, this room is supervised by three experienced staff in a loving and nurturing environment.
	Friendly and loving educators work alongside families to ensure the babies routines are properly met and followed through with love, care and patience. 
	Routines are flexible and adapted to suit the babies as they grow.
	<br><br>
    In the nursery room the babies have access to a large open room. We have two separate cot rooms that allow the children a comfortable and relaxing area to sleep and rest. 
	We have the enclosed verandah to allow the opportunity for children to engage in indoor/outdoor play even in varying weather conditions. 
	We have the flexibility to open this verandah up fully so that the children can explore the entire outdoor areas as well in a manner that allows maximum space to explore 
	and for curiosity to be nurtured. The outdoor areas are well shaded by either large trees or shade sails. 
	The indoor areas are all air-conditioned and have healthy air flow throughout. 
	We have nappy change facilities and child sized toilets and hand basins accessible with an educator.
	<br>
	</p>
</section>
<section class="column2">
	<h3>Play Areas</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;"> 
	<br>
	We ensure there is always a variety of natural materials and toys for the children to explore. Toys and play areas are frequently changed and adapted to babies current 
	interests and developmental needs. The babies are invited to engage in a wide range of sensory opportunities and safe challenges to aid in physical, social and emotional 
	development. The outside area of the nursery includes a large sandpit, garden bed and play equipment. This space offers areas for spontaneous messy and sensory play. 
	The space creates an aesthetic, inviting and natural area to play that both children, and educators, are proud of.

	<h3>Activities</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;"> 
	<br>
	There is so much to keep our little ones in this room constantly intrigued and challenged. We incorporate various sensory play, water play, cooking and art activities. 
	Educators try to use recycled materials throughout these experiences to reduce our environmental footprint together. Educators aim to provoke children’s development 
	through carefully thought out and planned experiences and invitations to explore a range of concepts. We even have full rain suits and boots available to use during 
	the winter months to allow the children to continue to explore the outdoor environments throughout the year.
	</p>
</section>
<section class="column2">
	<h3>Development</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;"> 
	<br>
	We regard each child as a unique individual. With developmental milestones in mind, we aim to respect each child’s needs and progress. 
	We believe each child learns in a different way and that they develop at their own rate. Through our interactions, conversations, observations and input from 
	families we scaffold each child’s learning and development along with The Early Years Learning Framework.

Toddlers</h2>
<article class="container2">
<section class="column1">
	<h3>Facilities</h3>
	<p style="text-align:left;"> 
	This room caters for 15 children aged from 2 to 3 years.
	With a ratio of one staff member to five children, this room is supervised by three experienced staff in a loving and nurturing environment.
	Staff are aware of each child’s routine and ensure that it is followed. Programs are used as a guide, but educators will observe children and 
	allow the day to follow their interests.
	<br>
	The toddlers have a large spacious room for indoor activities, set up with evolving environments and a range of daily experiences. 
	The toddlers have a large outdoor area, featuring a verandah, a large play structure with multiple interactive activities, a playground with a bridge and a slide. 
	They have a large area for running and a sandpit and cubby house. The toddlers room has nappy change facilities and child sized basins and toilets.
	</p>
</section>
<section class="column2">
	<h3>Play Areas</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;"> 
	<br>
	Through out the indoor and outdoor areas we cover all areas of development and have various areas set up. We have a quiet area, dramatic play area, construction, 
	creative, interest areas and many other fun little exploration areas. These change regularly to reflect the children’s interest and based on what observation and 
	extension of the children’s learning educators identify. We are able to develop and create spaces that create a sense of agency and independence and create environments 
	in which each child feels safe and secure as a part of the being, belonging and becoming principles.

	<h3>Activities</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;"> 
	<br>
	Each child’s sense of agency is nurtured and the toddlers are encouraged to enjoy indoor/outdoor play and have free flow between these areas during the majority of the day. 
	The toddlers explore many activities, experiences and routine activities that help to develop their skills. We encourage learning through play to provide authentic learning 
	opportunities. Toddlers activities are often interest based and designed with the children’s needs and strengths in mind. We adopt the Early Works curriculum which is an 
	online based program so parents can log on anytime and receive updates on their child’s progress and daily ventures. Some of the favourite activities are: cars, play dough, 
	dancing to music, stories and dressing up.

<section class="column2">
	<h3>Development</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;"> 
	<br>
	Alongside the Mundarda Philosophy, educators adopt their personal philosophy and pedagogy towards the way children learn. 
	Educators use this knowledge alongside The Early Years Learning Framework and developmental milestones to guide child development. 
	We aim to ensure each child develops a sense of belonging within the environment, is encouraged to be themselves and invited to learn and grow in their own unique way. 
	We adopt the Earlyworks curriculum, which is online based, providing parents the flexibility to log on and receive updates on their child’s progress easily throughout the day. 
	Through conversations, interactions and meaningful relationships built with families, individual developmental goals can be reached through partnerships created between care 
	and home.
