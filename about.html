	Mcc was founded in 1993 on a vision of giving children the best possible start in life through access to 
	quality early learning. We understand the level of trust you place in us when you enrol your child, and we are 
	committed to providing the highest standards of care and education possible, with experienced and qualified 
	educators and using the best high quality facilities.

	<h3>Profile</h3>
	<p style="text-align:left;">
	
	<br>
	We make every moment count. 
	Right from birth, children are ready to learn and at Mundarda we employ the most up-to-date thinking in early 
	childhood education to create stimulating, age-appropriate learning environments that give children a secure base 
	and the confidence to explore. 
	<br>  
	We're for children, not profit.
	At Mundarda, we’re all about laying the foundation for better lives through great early learning experiences. 
	We’re entirely Australian owned and not-for profit with every dollar we spend directed towards helping children reach their full potential. 
	Everything we do is about contributing to a better outlook for Australia’s children and a happier, more prosperous society.

    <h3>Why Mundarda</h3>
	<p style="text-align:left;">
	
	<br>
	We regard each child as a unique individual and allow children to explore their environment through challenging play experiences.
	<br>
	We take safety seriously. Yes, we offer plenty of opportunities to get messy, explore, and try new things. We also follow strict health and safety guidelines, 
	keep our first-aid qualifications current and ensure our comprehensive child safety policies and procedures are followed at all times.
	<br>
	Large Play Areas. Our centre is fortunate to have three large outdoor play areas which are all shaded by trees and additional shade cloth. 
	Inside there are numerous toys, games and books to keep the children learning via play.
