Introduction </h2>
<p>
Mundarda is a place where children feel secure and loved. Where play is a priority, 
but where play is carefully designed to develop and enhance the children’s physical, social, emotional and cognitive needs.
We understand that each child is unique, each child learns differently at different rates and that a trusting, caring environment fosters learning.
We emphasise on child development through appropriate activities and encourage children to play creatively and are able to choose from a variety of 
indoor and outdoor activities in a positive, stimulating and safe environment.
Children need to recognise and appreciate the special qualities of all individuals by listening to one another, by helping one another and by 
learning from one another, so that a true sense of individuals within the community develops. We aim to stimulate your child’s natural curiosity 
and encourage personal expression so they can develop into confident, caring,
happy individuals. The centre is equipped to meet the needs of children in each appropriate age group that encourage children to learn, play and explore.
Mundards Educators are a team of dedicated and caring professionals who are trained in early childhood development. We are dedicated to provide a high 
quality service within a warm, nurturing, secure, fun environment and we have a strong commitment to meet the needs of children and their families. 
We provide this quality by ensuring, adequate child to staff ratios, qualified staff, staff continuity and a healthy, clean and safe environment. 
Your child needs to know you have confidence in us so that we will also have their confidence.
We are fully accredited by the National Childcare Accreditation Council (NCAC) and therefore maintain the High Quality Practices developed by NCAC.

Progress</h2>
<p>
At Mundarda we use the online program EarlyWorks to document on your children’s progress and contribution to the room within they are cared for. 
Through observations and photos,  you are able to interact with educators using the online portal with your own personal login. 
Children’s profiles are updated regularly by educators and you are able to save any material and access centre documents directly from your personal device. 
Feel free to ask a staff member to show you how the program works and is used within the centre.
